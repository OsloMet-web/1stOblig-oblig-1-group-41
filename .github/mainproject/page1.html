        <h3>Pros of working in a group</h3>
        <section>
            <p>Working in small groups gives ground for more ideas,</br>
                because there are more people that can contribute.
            </br>People are also good at different things,
                which means </br>all can contribute more in certain aspects of a specific task.

                <p>Work becomes more effective since more people work on the</br> same task at once.
                This means we spare more time and get</br> more things done in a specific time window.</p>

           <p>Working in groups is essential for constructive criticism,</br>
             which again is important for self-growth and getting</br> different perspectives and many things.</p>
