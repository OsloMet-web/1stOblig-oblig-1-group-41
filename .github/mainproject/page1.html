        <h3>Pros of working in a group</h3>
            <p>Working in small groups gives ground for more ideas,</br>
                because there are more people that can contribute.
            </br>People are also good at different things,
                which means </br>all participants can contribute more in certain aspects of a specific task.



                <p>Working becomes more effective since more people work on the</br> same task at once.
                This means we spare more time and get</br> more things done in a specific time window.</p>



           <p>Working in groups is essential for constructive criticism,</br>
             which again is important for self-growth and getting</br> different perspectives at many things and ideas.</p>
            <h3>Cons of working in a group</h3>
            <p>Working in groups can often make people distracted,
                because there is a lot going on.</br> Bias can also occur between people,
                 if someone does not like one another.</p>

            <p>Sometimes it may be hard to be heard across many people,
            which</br> means some people can be more or less ignored or not given
            enough attention. </br>Some people will in consequence say more,
            while others will still have something to say but won’t be able to </p>
            <p>Time waste may occur due to small things like finding a group room,</br>
            technical difficulties or simply people not being on time or not having enough time.

            </p>
