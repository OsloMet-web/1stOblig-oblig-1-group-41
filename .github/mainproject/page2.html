            Malakoff videregående skole</a> is a school located in city Moss, south-east from Oslo.</br>
            The line i went was called studiespesialisering, and i attended school 3 years in total.</br>
            I studied many different courses, from which my favourites were chemistry and maths</br>
            The school itself is located close to the centre of Moss, which makes it perfectly accessible</br>
            for most people. My 3 years in this school were some of the greatest years of my life, where</br>
            i got to meet many of my current friends and studied some great courses.

            The education and teachers were of high quality, and I think I received a good education. </br>
            I made good friends, and its location was close to where I lived." </p>
